## Introduction
Owning property comes hand in hand with the occasional critter stopping by for a visit or attempting to make a more permanent residence. Such critters commonly include birds, racoons, squirrels, and various insects. In Florida, many homeowners encounter snakes on their property. While not extremely common, these encounter are sure to occur more frequently as more and more people move to the state. In 2024 Florida is predicted to have 275,000 new residents move from out of state. Most of these new residents have no knowledge of the local wildlife, and unfortunately snakes are not well liked.

## Buisness Problem
Snakes are a vital part of the Florida ecosystem. The new Florida residents likely do not know the benefits and risks of living near and around snakes. Snakes are not only fantastic pest control, but many nonvenomous/harmless species such as the Florida Kingsnake will drive away venomous snakes making your property safer. It is my goal to provide an image classification model to help identify whether a snake is venomous or nonvenomous to help residents begin to adjust to their scaley neighbors.
